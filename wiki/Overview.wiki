= Introduction =

Formaliser aims to do for HTML forms what ORMs did for DB schemas by automating the transformation of classes into HTML forms and request parameters back into classes.

= An example =

The two most important classes are FormWriter and FormReader.

FormWriter produces a list of FormElements, which are simple data classes used by a templating engine to generate the appropriate HTML.

{{{
FormWriter writer = new FormWriter().forJpa();
List<FormElement> form = writer.toForm("user", myUserInstance);
}}}

JPA annotations can be used to specify which fields are required and other constraints.

FormReader takes a HttpServletRequest's parameter map and turns it into a given class.

{{{
FormReader reader = new FormReader();
MyUser myUserInstance = reader.read("user", MyUser.class, parameterMap, 0);
}}}

The entity instance can then be validated (by a Bean Validation implementation, for example), handed off to a controller, etc.
